The script can automatically build collections, edit collection metadata, and change collection images using the `collections` attribute.

Each collection is defined by the mapping name which becomes the name of the Plex collection.

There are three types of attributes in collections
1. **[Collection Builders](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Builders):** attribute that adds items to the collection
2. **[Collection Details](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Details):** attribute that changes a collections details
3. **[Collection Filters](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Filters):** attributes that filters items added to all collection builders
