You can build different collections using the features of Plex.

No configuration is required for these builders.

| Name | Attribute | Description | Works with Movies | Works with Shows |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| [Plex All](#plex-all) | `plex_all` | Gets every movie/show in your library. Useful with [collection filters](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Filters) | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Plex Collection](#plex-collection) | `plex_collection` | Gets every movie/show in another Plex Collection | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Plex Collectionless](#plex-collectionless) | `plex_collectionless` | Gets every movie/show that is not in a collection | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [Plex Search](#plex-search) | `plex_search` | Gets every movie/show based on the search parameters provided | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

## Plex All
Gets every movie/show in your library. Useful with [collection filters](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Filters).

The expected input is either true or false.

```yaml
collections:
  9.0 Movies:
    all: true
    filters:
      rating.gte: 9
```

## Plex Collection
Gets every movie/show in another Plex Collection.

The expected input is the exact name of a Collection in Plex

```yaml
collections:
  Dinosaurs:
    plex_collection: Jurassic Park
```

If you want to add multiple collections you have to use a list. Comma-separated values will not work.

```yaml
collections:
  Dinosaurs:
    plex_collection:
      - Jurassic Park
      - The Land Before Time
```

## Plex Collectionless
Gets every movie/show that is not in a collection unless the collection is in the exclusion list. This is a special collection type to help keep your library looking correct. When items in your library are in multiple collections it can mess up how they're displayed in your library.

For Example, if you have a `Marvel Cinematic Universe` Collection set to `Show this collection and its items` and an `Iron Man` Collection set to `Hide items in this collection` what happens is the show overrides the hide and you end up with both collections displaying as well as the 3 Iron Man movies.

Alternatively, if you set the `Marvel Cinematic Universe` Collection to `Hide items in this collection` then movies without a collection like `The Incredible Hulk` will be hidden from the library view.

To combat the problem above you set all collections to `Hide items in this collection` then create a collection set to `Hide collection` and put every movie that you still want to display in that collection. 

With the variability of collections generated by the Plex Meta Manager maintaining a collection like this becomes very difficult, so in order to automate it, you can use `plex_collectionless`. You just have to tell it what collections to exclude or what collection prefixes to exclude.

There are two attributes for `plex_collectionless`, `exclude` (To exclude specific collections) and `exclude_prefix` (To exclude every collection whose title or sort title starts with the prefix). At least one exclusion is required.

```yaml
collections:
  Collectionless:
    plex_collectionless:
      exclude_prefix:
        - +
        - ~
      exclude: Marvel Cinematic Universe
    sort_title: ~_Collectionless
    collection_order: alpha
```

* Both `exclude` and `exclude_prefix` can take multiple values as a List.
* This is a known issue with Plex Collection and there is a [Feature Suggestion](https://forums.plex.tv/t/collection-display-issue/305406) detailing the issue more on their forms.

## Plex Search
Uses Plex's [Custom Filters](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200392126-using-the-library-view/) to get every movie/show based on the search parameters provided.

Any Custom Filter search made using the Plex UI should be able to be recreated using `plex_search`. If you're having trouble getting `plex_search` to work correctly, take a screenshot of the custom filters parameters in the Plex UI and post it in either the [Discussions](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NfH6mGFuAB) 

The search will return every movie/show that matches at least one term from each search option unless you use the `.and` modifier in which case it would need to match every term.

* Multiple values are supported as either a list or a comma-separated string for all modifiers except `.before`, `.after`, `.greator`, and `.less`.
* If you want to restrict the search even further try using [Collection Filters](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Filters).

```yaml
collections:
  Documentaries:
    plex_search:
      genre: Documentary
```
```yaml
collections:
  Dave Chappelle Comedy:
    plex_search:
      actor: Dave Chappelle
      genre: Comedy
```
```yaml
collections:
  Pixar:
    plex_search:
      studio: Pixar
```
```yaml
collections:
  90s Movies:
    plex_search:
      year:
        - 1990
        - 1991
        - 1992
        - 1993
        - 1994
        - 1995
        - 1996
        - 1997
        - 1998
        - 1999
```
```yaml
collections:
  90s Movies:
    plex_search:
      year: 1990-1999
```
```yaml
collections:
  2010+ Movies:
    plex_search:
      year.greater: 2009
```
```yaml
collections:
  90s Movies:
    plex_search:
      decade: 1990
```

If you only want to search using a single attribute you can do so without `plex_search`.

```yaml
collections:
  90s Movies:
    year: 1990-1999
```

If you specify TMDb Person ID's using the [Collection Detail](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Collection-Details) `tmdb_person` and then tell either `actor`, `director`, `producer`, or `writer` to add `tmdb`, the script will translate the TMDb Person IDs into their names and run the search on those names.

```yaml
collections:
  Robin Williams:
    actor: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 2157
```
```yaml
collections:
  Steven Spielberg:
    director: tmdb
    tmdb_person: https://www.themoviedb.org/person/488-steven-spielberg
```
```yaml
collections:
  Quentin Tarantino:
    actor: tmdb
    director: tmdb
    producer: tmdb
    writer: tmdb
    tmdb_person: 138
```
