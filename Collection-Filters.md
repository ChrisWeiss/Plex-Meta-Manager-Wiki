Collection filters allow for you to filter every movie/show added to the collection from every collection builder using the `filters` attribute. 

You can have multiple collection filters but a movie/show must match at least one value from **each** collection filter to be added to a collection. The values for each must match what Plex has including special characters in order to match.

All collection filter options are listed below.
